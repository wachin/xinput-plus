# Adjust your mouse or touchpad speed (very easy!)

This program is for **Linux** and allows you to **change the pointer speed** (mouse or touchpad cursor) graphically for use in X11 Window Managers such as: Openbox, JWM, iceWM, Fluxbox, and other minimalist window managers where there's no GUI program to do this, without having to type complicated commands. It's ideal if you use external keyboards that come with **integrated touchpad keyboard**, like the **Logitech K400**, or even for your laptop's touchpad if you feel the cursor moves too slowly.

---

## üéØ What is it for?

- ‚úÖ Increase or decrease mouse or touchpad speed.
- ‚úÖ Save configuration so it doesn't get lost when restarting.
- ‚úÖ Works with devices like:
  - Keyboards with touchpad (e.g.: Logitech K400)
  - USB mice
  - Laptop touchpads

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Requirements

Before using it, make sure you have the following installed on your Linux computer:

```bash
sudo apt install xinput git libinput-tools python3-pyqt6 python3-simplejson libqt6svg6
```

1. ‚ö†Ô∏è This program only works on **X11**, not on Wayland.  
2. It's only for X11 WM like Openbox, JWM, iceWM, Fluxbox, Xubuntu, etc
3. In 2025, for example in GNOME, KDE, before logging in you can select X11 to enter instead of Wayland.

## üöÄ How to use the program

### **1st OPTION: Download the repository**
At:

[https://github.com/wachin/xinput-plus](https://github.com/wachin/xinput-plus)

click on the arrow-like dropdown in Code:

**<>  Code ‚ñº**

and click on:

**Download ZIP**

decompress it, and there inside the folder is the `xinput-plus.py` file.

or you can clone it:

### **2nd OPTION: Clone the repository**

**1.-** Since we already have git installed, enter in a terminal in a folder where you have Linux programs:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wachin/xinput-plus
```

**2.-** Give it execution permissions

It can be done by right-clicking in the **file manager** and in the "**Permissions**" tab verify that it's marked as executable

or from the terminal with:

```bash
chmod +x xinput-plus.py
```

## Running with Launcher.sh

Make sure the `Launcher.sh` script is executable, in the file manager right-click on it and in the "**Permissions**" tab make sure "**is executable**" is checked

Double-click the `Launcher.sh` script and click `Execute`

üëâ A window will open with two controls:

> üí° On some Linux distributions you can right-click on the `xinput-plus.py` file and open with python.

---

## üéõÔ∏è How to use it

1. When opening the program.
2. In the left list, **click on your device** (for example: "Logitech K400").
3. Use the slider to change the speed:
   - ‚Üê Slower (down to -1.0)
   - ‚Üí Faster (up to 1.0 by default)
4. **Enable extended speed (optional)**: Check the box labeled "Enable extended speed (up to 2.0)" to allow the slider to go up to 2.0, which provides significantly faster cursor movement for devices like the Logitech K400. This mode uses the `Coordinate Transformation Matrix` to scale pointer movement beyond the standard range.
5. When you find the perfect speed, click **"Save configuration"**.

‚úÖ Done! The change applies instantly and is saved for next time. The program remembers whether extended speed mode is enabled for each device. After restarting your computer, open the program, select your device, and the saved settings (including extended speed mode) will be applied automatically.

---

## üíæ Where is the configuration saved?

The program saves your settings in this file (don't delete it if you don't want to lose the configuration):

```
~/.config/xinput-plus.json
```

---

## Using the system Dark Theme (Qt6 + Kvantum)

**xinput-plus** is a **PyQt6** app, so it follows your **Qt6** theme. To use a dark theme system-wide via **Kvantum**:

### Debian 12 (Bookworm)

1. **Install Qt6 theming tools**

```bash
sudo apt install qt6ct qt6-style-kvantum
```

2. **Select the style in Qt6 Settings**

* Open **qt6ct** ‚Üí **Appearance / Style** ‚Üí choose **Kvantum**.
* (Optional) Open **Kvantum Manager** and pick your favorite **dark** theme.

3. **Restart xinput-plus**
   No app changes are required‚Äîxinput-plus will automatically adopt the system dark theme.

> **Note (LXQt on Debian 12):** As you observed, **no environment variables** were needed‚ÄîLXQt already exposes the Qt6 platform theme correctly.

![](assets/images/02-xinput-plus%20dark%20theme.png)

### Other desktops / window managers

Some environments don‚Äôt expose the Qt6 platform theme by default. If the dark theme doesn‚Äôt apply after the steps above, set these **environment variables** (pick *one* place, e.g. your `Launcher.sh`, `~/.profile`, or the app‚Äôs `.desktop` file):

```bash
export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt6ct
export QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=kvantum
```

Then log out/in or restart the app.

> **Heads-up:** `qt5ct` only affects **Qt5** applications. For **PyQt6/Qt6** apps like xinput-plus, you need **qt6ct** (and `qt6-style-kvantum`).

---

## ü§ì How does it work internally?

It uses Linux commands with `xinput` to change the device speed in real time. For standard speed adjustments, it modifies the `libinput Accel Speed` property. For extended speed mode (up to 2.0), it uses the `Coordinate Transformation Matrix` to scale pointer movement, allowing higher sensitivity for devices that need it. The interface does everything for you!

## üõ†Ô∏è Want to improve this program?

This code is made in Python with PyQt6, perfect for students who want to learn about:
- Graphical interfaces
- Linux automation
- Hardware control

Feel free to modify it, improve it, or use it in your projects!

## üõë Troubleshooting

### **"Permission denied" errors when running the program**

If the program not working when running from terminal you see errors like:

`Failed to open /dev/input/eventX (Permission denied)`

when running `xinput-plus.py`, it means your user lacks permission to access input devices. This is common in minimal Linux installations (e.g., Debian netinstall). To fix it:
    
1. **Add your user to the `input` group**:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG input $USER
```

   Log out and back in, or reboot, to apply the change.

2. **Verify permissions**:
   Check that `/dev/input/event*` files are accessible:
   
```bash
ls -l /dev/input/event*
```

   They should have group `input` and permissions like 
   
**Restart**

# Internationalization (i18n) Guide

This app supports translations with Qt **`.ts` ‚Üí `.qm`** files. Follow these steps to add **any language** (Spanish shown as example).

---

## Requirements

* **Qt Creator** installed on your Linux OS
* **PyQt6 dev tools** (provides `pylupdate6`):

```bash
sudo apt install pyqt6-dev-tools
```
* Qt Linguist & lrelease from Qt5 (work fine for app translations):

```bash
sudo apt install qttools5-dev-tools
```
* Create the translations folder:

```bash
mkdir -p i18n
```

> The app loads compiled files from **`./i18n/`** (same directory as `xinput-plus.py`), e.g. `i18n/xinput-plus_es.qm`.

---

## Spanish example (es)

### 1) Extract source strings ‚Üí `.ts`

```bash
pylupdate6 --ts i18n/xinput-plus_es.ts xinput-plus.py
```

### 2) Translate with Qt Linguist

* **From Qt Creator**: right-click `xinput-plus_es.ts` ‚Üí open with Linguist ‚Üí translate ‚Üí mark entries as **Finished** ‚Üí Save.
* **From terminal**:

  ```bash
  linguist i18n/xinput-plus_es.ts
  ```

### 3) Compile `.ts` ‚Üí `.qm` in `i18n/`
You can do this from the "Qt Linguist" tool from Qt Creator by clicking on "File - Distribute As" and saving as .qm, or from terminal:

```bash
# Use whichever lrelease exists on your system:
LREL=$(command -v lrelease-qt6 || command -v lrelease || echo /usr/lib/qt5/bin/lrelease)
$LREL i18n/xinput-plus_es.ts -qm i18n/xinput-plus_es.qm
```

### 4) Run the app in Spanish

```bash
python3 xinput-plus.py --lang=es
```

---

## Any other language

Replace the language code:

```bash
# French (fr)
pylupdate6 --ts i18n/xinput-plus_fr.ts xinput-plus.py
linguist i18n/xinput-plus_fr.ts
$LREL i18n/xinput-plus_fr.ts -qm i18n/xinput-plus_fr.qm
python3 xinput-plus.py --lang=fr

# Brazilian Portuguese (pt_BR)
pylupdate6 --ts i18n/xinput-plus_pt_BR.ts xinput-plus.py
linguist i18n/xinput-plus_pt_BR.ts
$LREL i18n/xinput-plus_pt_BR.ts -qm i18n/xinput-plus_pt_BR.qm
python3 xinput-plus.py --lang=pt_BR
```

**File naming:** the loader tries common patterns like `xinput-plus_es.qm`, `xinput-plus_es_ES.qm`, and `xinput-plus_es-ES.qm`. Putting `xinput-plus_<lang>.qm` inside `./i18n` is sufficient.

---

Here‚Äôs a ready-to-paste addition for your **README.md**. It extends the i18n section with filename requirements and safe placeholder translation guidance.

---

## Important notes for translations

### 1) Use the canonical filename when extracting strings

The extraction command assumes your main file is named **`xinput-plus.py`**:

```bash
pylupdate6 --ts i18n/xinput-plus_es.ts xinput-plus.py
```

* **Do NOT** change `xinput-plus.py` to another filename while developing the program.
  During development, new UI strings are added frequently; if you point `pylupdate6` at some other file, those new strings **won‚Äôt** be picked up and **won‚Äôt** appear in the `.ts` for translation.
* If you really want to experiment with a differently named file (e.g., a versioned copy), do it in a **separate folder** and treat it as a separate exercise‚Äînot the one you use to develop and extract strings from.

**If you must use multiple source files**, pass **all** of them to `pylupdate6`:

```bash
pylupdate6 --ts i18n/xinput-plus_es.ts xinput-plus.py other_module.py optional_extras.py
```

This ensures every translatable string is included in the `.ts`.

---

### 2) Translating safely in Qt Linguist (placeholders!)

When you open the `.ts` in **Qt Linguist (Qt 5 Linguist)**, be careful with strings that include **placeholders**. You may **translate only the normal words**, **not** the placeholders inside braces.

**Examples:**

* Source:

  ```
  Device: {name} (id {id})
  ```

  ‚úÖ Correct Spanish:

  ```
  Dispositivo: {name} (id {id})
  ```
  
![](assets/images/03-Qt-5-Linguist-when-you-go-to-translate-the-program-to-the-spanish.png)

  (translate only ‚ÄúDevice‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúDispositivo‚Äù; keep `{name}` and `{id}` exactly as they are)

* Source:

  ```
  Device: {name}
  ```

  ‚úÖ Correct Spanish:

  ```
  Dispositivo: {name}
  ```

* Source:

  ```
  Speed: {val:.2f}
  ```

  ‚úÖ Correct Spanish:

  ```
  Velocidad: {val:.2f}
  ```

> **Never change** the content inside `{ ... }` (names, formats, punctuation).
> If you alter `{name}`, `{id}`, or `{val:.2f}`, the program won‚Äôt work correctly at runtime.

---

### 3) Compile after translating

After updating translations in Linguist (and marking them as **Finished**), compile to `.qm`:

```bash
# pick whichever lrelease exists on your system
LREL=$(command -v lrelease-qt6 || command -v lrelease || echo /usr/lib/qt5/bin/lrelease)
$LREL i18n/xinput-plus_es.ts -qm i18n/xinput-plus_es.qm
```

Then run the app:

```bash
python3 xinput-plus.py --lang=es
```

You should see Spanish UI and, on recent versions, a console line like:

```
[i18n] Loaded app translation: xinput-plus_es.qm
```

---

## Developer note

* Source strings in `xinput-plus.py` are wrapped in `self.tr("‚Ä¶")` so `pylupdate6` can extract them.
* The app‚Äôs i18n loader **keeps `QTranslator` references alive** to avoid Python GC, ensuring translations apply from startup.
